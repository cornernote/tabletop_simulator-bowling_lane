# Automated Bowling Lane

A fully scripted bowling lane for Tabletop Simulator!

Spawn pins and balls with a single button, knock the pins down, and watch them despawn automatically.

Balls will also clean themselves up when they fall off the board or drop lower than their last resting point.

Perfect for quick games of bowling with friends.
